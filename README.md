# Welcome to My Tempest of SimpleBot Scripts 🎮

## Why This Exists
Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository, the magical wonderland where my journey of learning Java has unfolded. Yes, I chose to learn Java in the quirkiest manner possible—by writing a bunch of scripts for SimpleBot, an RSPS bot. Who knew programming could be this much fun, right?

## What You'll Find Here
This repository is basically my trophy case of Java learning milestones, filled with scripts for various botting activities. Some highlight features include:

- **GPT Chat Interaction Plugin**: This little gem lets your bot chat up a storm, making it look incredibly human-like. Nothing spells “I’m not a robot” better than engaging in witty banter while botting! 🤖💬 You can find the code in the eApiAccess folder.

- **eAutoFighterBot**: An intelligent auto fighter bot that can practically take on any NPC in the game. It eats, uses special attacks, swaps weapons, toggles prayers, drinks potions, and so much more. It’s like having a battle-ready Swiss Army knife, but in code form! 🗡️📜

## The Main Takeaway
Sure, I could have followed a typical Java learning path, but where's the fun in that? So, behold, my collection of scripts that represent a blend of automated tasks and enlightening Java lessons. Dive in, mess around, and perhaps learn something too!

Happy botting, fellow coder! 💻✨

_**P.S.**: If your bot starts developing a sense of humor, don’t say I didn’t warn you._
